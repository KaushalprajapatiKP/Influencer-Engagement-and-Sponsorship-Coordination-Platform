# Influencer-Engagement-and-Sponsorship-Coordination-Platform
IESCP V2 connects sponsors with influencers for managing advertising campaigns. The platform uses Flask for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and SQLite for data storage. It features role-based access control, automated reminders, and monthly reports, with background tasks handled by Celery and Redis for improved performance and caching.
